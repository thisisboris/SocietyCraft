SocietyCraft - A Bukkit plugin.
Authors: cskiwi, thisisboris.

Somewhere mid 2011 I started playing minecraft actively online with a couple of friends. 
Since I had an old desktop PC I decided to host a small server using a few Plugins. Sometime later we changed the look of our
server, different plugins, survival/adventure mode with NPC's, Towns, Nations, Wars, which lead to issues. It's hard to maintain and
update Plugins, especially with the BukkitChanges, and with plugins no longer being updated, or even with Devs being just plain rude and 
annoying, which leads to stepping away from a certain plugin.

So we decided it was time to learn a new programming language, Java, and learn how to make a decent Bukkit plugin. 
This will be our first Plugin, and we'll be actively testing the plugin. A lot. It'll introduce an advanced Nation/region/town system, 
with easy to set up houses, churches, libraries and so forth. Empty houses will be bought by NPCs after sometime, who do jobs in a jobs system.
This jobs system will also be available for the player, so that he can pay the taxes of the town, buy a house, and trade with both Players as NPC's
that trade.

It will require lot's of time and Cola/Energy drinks, pizzas and others , but at least we'll have a stable plugin, that adds everything
an Adventure/RPG server would need to function. With devs who ARE friendly!
